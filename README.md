## First, look at the picture to better understand synchronization and asynchronous concepts.

- **Synchronous code** runs line by line, waiting for each line to finish before moving to the next one. Itâ€™s like an inline process where the program can't move forward until the current line has been completed.

**Example (Synchronous):**

- **Asynchronous code** does not wait. It moves to the next line while the async task works in the background. Async code is like a method that runs in the background (with callbacks), and once it finishes, the callback is executed.

**Example (Asynchronous):**

- In **synchronous** execution, each step waits for the previous one to complete. In **asynchronous** execution, the program continues running while it waits for an operation (like a setTimeout or a network request) to finish. 


**Synchronous Execution Process:**  
1. Executes the first line.  
2. Waits for it to complete before moving to the next line.

**Asynchronous Execution Process:**  
1. Executes the first line.  
2. Moves to the next line without waiting.  
3. The callback of the async task runs once the task completes.
